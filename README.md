Pyber Ridesharing Company Background
Pyber is new ride sharing company imerging into the ride sharing market and competing against giant ride sharing comanies like Uber and lyft. Being a newly appointed Data Strategist of this comapny I need to offer data backed guidance on a new opportunities for market differentiation.

After creating Bubble chart and few pie charts based on avaialable data here are my Obervable trends:

Pyber is growing simeltenuously in urban, suburban and rural areas. However, the demand vs supply in each regions is very different.

By looking at Pyber Ride Sharing bubble chart, I can say that there is a negative correlation between No of Rides and Average fare. The more the average fare less the no of rides. The demand for ride sharing is more in Urban cities, so does drivers count which leads to more compettion and reduced Average fare. There are few exceptions to this where there is high demand and less no of drivers avaialability and vise versa.

Looking at "Total fares by city" and "Total rides by city" pie chart I can say that, the profit margin is more in Suburban and Rural area as compared to ride sharing market vs profit margin and ride sharing market from Urban cities. That means there is an opportunity to grow more in Suburban and rural areas.

Looking at "Total drivers by City" pie chart, I can see that, drivers avaialability is 77% more than the rural cities, which tells there is an opportunity to get more business from Urban cities as well.

The company should do the follwing two things to benefit more from exisitng drivers:

Lower the average fare in rural cities which might increase the demand of ride sharing.
Increasing the average fare by 10 % (after obeserving competitors average fare price for that region), where demand is already high, will increse company profits.
